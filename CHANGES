ptvtwm-1.0b1

Clean up some comments and typos

Look for program-specific default startup file. For example, if
invoked as foowm, it will look for system.foowmrc before system.twmrc

Updated the man page.

Look for xloadimage in TWMDIR (so I can ship a private copy)

ptvtwm-1.0a2

Added missing includes to fix up implicit function declaration warnings.

Removed unused variables identified by lint

Removed OLD_MOVE protected code from menus.c

Killed the staff group stuff from parse.c - NG_*, def_netmask(),
getmask(), names[], isstaff()

Remove code guarded by #if 0 in events.c, parse.c, menus.c

Pie submenus actually work now.

Remove unnecessary elements of menu structures the pie menu code added,
as they are constants. Removed slice, label_radius_min,
label_radius_step, inactive_radius.

Keep pie menus on screen

main() in twm loses environ argument

pull out common code in PaintPieMenuEntry()

Stopped pie menu items showing border debris as you mouse off

Get pie submenus to appear in a more sensible place

TWM_TYPE (for m4) set to the name of the binary, so if you link it to
multiple ones it will look like whichever one it's called as.

Set search order of startup files depending on executable name.

ptvtwm-1.0a1

Hacked in pie menus from piewm 1.04 to the point where they actually
started to work.
