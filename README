ptvtwm - Peter's tvtwm, or Pie tvtwm, if you prefer.

Once there was tvtwm - Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager

Along came piewm, a derivative of an old version of tvtwm that added
experimental support for pie menus

I wanted to see what piewm did, and tried to make piewm work, but it
seemed to mess up the config file parsing and would never do anything
useful as a result. After evaluating a couple of options, I decided
that it would be much easier to take the pie menu pieces and add them
to a working copy of tvtwm than to work out why lex was going wrong
(and I have no familiarity with lex). Furthermore, piewm was built on
an older branch of tvtwm, so by starting from the latest tvtwm all the
enhancements and fixes that have been made to tvtwm since piewm
branched off get picked up as well.

To be specific, this is piewm 1.04 code added to tvtwm patchlevel 11.

This worked surprisingly well, despite that the fact that I don't
really understand how X or window managers work (although I'm starting
to understand some of it by making this all work), and despite that
fcat that tvtwm had changed quite significantly in some important
areas. It still works as tvtwm, and mostly works as piewm. (One
difficulty I have is that I never got piewm working, so don't have a
baseline to compare to, hence my claim that it mostly works.)

The working version that I came up with is ptvtwm-1.0a1.

It's been tweaked a little in the decade or more since to make it
build with modern compilers.
