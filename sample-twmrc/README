  This directory ideally should contain some .twmrc files hat illustrate
the higher points of tvtwm.  But, it's very hard to look at .twmrc files
with this version of tvtwm, because tvtwm uses m4 to preprocess all of it's
config files, but I've included my .twmrc file anyway.  As you see, it
include's three other config files from my home directory, and a centrally
maintained hostlist menu.  This is one of the great uses of m4.

  At any rate, I hope you can extract something useful from this.
